% Here it is.
% Three functions:
% (1) fit3doubleexp.m  - fit for a single g2 curve. Use it the same way as your fit1 and fit2 functions.
% (2) fit_g2s_doubleexp.m - use viewresultinfo as input argument. Fit for multiple g2 curves in a single batch. For multiple batches, you need to run a for loop in your script. Use the function the same way as your fit_cluster_g2s.m
% (3) viewresult_doubleexp.m - plot the result
